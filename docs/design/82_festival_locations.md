# 82. Festival locations and spots

Settled with the owner on 2026-11-11. This is step 2 of the layout track
(`docs/handoffs/PRIORITIES.md`, note 80 item 3, note 81). It supersedes the
note 66 addendum rule that every festival loads a decorated variant of the
Hearthwell south green: only the Harvest Showing is on the green now.

## Decisions (owner, 2026-11-11)

1. **Attendance: nearly everyone in town attends, with a few skipping
   (Stardew, from memory, unchecked).** Not the Night Market's fixed 18. Who
   skips each festival is still to design (see "To design").
2. **Only one festival is on the green.** The rest are spread over places that
   exist or are planned. Chosen: the "spread slate" below.
3. **Spots are exact tile positions** (the owner asked for this), written once
   each location's festival layout is drawn, not before. Locations first.
4. **Off-green positions for Frostday and Hollow Eve** are fixed positions,
   to be designed with their layouts.

## Locations

| Festival | Date | Place | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hat Parade | Spring 10 | Hearthwell town square and middle street | A parade route along the street through the square |
| Seedswap Fair | Spring 21 | Forest clearing by the farmstead | Stardew's Flower Dance is in its forest (memory, unchecked) |
| Cake Day | Summer 8 | The inn and its lane | Hosted by the inn keeper's family |
| Lamplight Evening | Summer 24 | The Beach at dusk | Lanterns along the shore. The elf's cottage is there |
| Harvest Showing | Fall 9 | The festival green | The only festival on the green. Judge's table and prize counter are built |
| Hollow Eve | Fall 21 | The hedge map and its entrance plaza | Villagers at the plaza booth and at the scares |
| Frostday | Winter 8 | The Forest lake, frozen | Ice fishing. Stardew's ice festival is at a forest lake (memory, unchecked) |
| Midwinter Feast | Winter 25 | Inside the hall, at the Long Table | Must fit all players with room to pass (note 81 decision 12) |

The Winter Night Market stays on the Hearthwell square (note 14), with its 18
spots already designed.

## What this changes

- The Hearthwell decorated variant (note 66 addendum, item 6) is now for the
  Showing, the Hat Parade and the Night Market. The others need festival
  layouts on their own maps (Forest, Beach, hall interior, inn lane).
- Players arrive from the farm to a place that may be a long walk. How the
  festival invitation sends them there, and where the eight player start spots
  stand on each, is part of each layout.
- Shop and home locking applies in Hearthwell; on the Forest and Beach there is
  nothing to lock.

## To design next (in this order)

1. Who skips each festival (a short list per festival; area residents may attend
   the one nearest them).
2. The festival layout for each place, with a Tiled draft: props, the 8 player
   start spots, the prize counter or stalls, and the exact villager tiles.
3. The Frostday ice holes and the Hollow Eve positions.
4. Route data: a `festival` spot per person per festival (note 79 data shape),
   and `festivals.json` naming each festival's map.

Register: SC-127 added to note 54 (which place Stardew uses for each festival,
and who skips). Check by the saved Calendar page.
