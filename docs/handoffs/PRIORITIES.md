# Design priority list

The single live copy. Read it at the start of each session, show the owner the open
items and the layout track, and ask which to take. Update it in the handoff pull request.

Keep this file under about 8 KB. One or two lines per item, with a pointer to the note
or issue for detail. Move finished items and built-status detail to
`PRIORITIES_ARCHIVE.md` in the same pull request. Do not keep a session log here; the
handoffs hold that. Full history to 2026-11-11 is in the archive.

## Milestone order (ADR 0012)

M3 (close out: the owner's play), M3b ring 1 systems, M4 multiplayer, M3c story and
ending, M3d polish, then M5 and M6. Map areas (notes 71 to 78) are M3b.

## Open, in order

1. **Completion tracker (#196).** Built (PR #573). Left: real lines and art with the
   voice sheets, a browser look at the summit scene and layout.
2. **Story spine.** Warden head (#177), sea elf (#176) and Rosmarin (#178) settled bar
   small items. The third community project (#5) waits for ring 2 (M5). Needed before
   slice 5 (note 33).
2b. **Ancestors' shrine (note 83).** Left: the Diamond's name, art and drops (SC-135),
   the shrine tiles (farm layout, #776), scene shots, camp chest items (note 22).
3. **Map areas (notes 71 to 78).** All built to shell level (#636 to #646, #649, #661).
   Left items are in each note's "Built status". Build detail is in the archive.
4. **Art direction and audio plan.** Character art (note 15), hall rooms (#335),
   placeholder swap, audio (#527).
5. **Ring 2 shape and travel (#20, M5).** Parked until slice 3 is played.

## M3b completeness (audit 2026-11-12)

M3b is not done: bundles 1 to 26 cannot all be filled. Open issues are in the M3b
milestone (#869 to #880, #396). Design first: goods hand-in (#875), placement for rod and
lamps (#877), elderfruit (#874), heart event list (#873). Owner calls: Last Seat gate
(#869), Guests' Board reward (#871). File the M4 hosting spike before M4.

## Layout and tiles track (note 81)

Rules: `docs/design/81_layout_shared_rules.md`. Art waits for M3d.

Done, owner checked (2026-11-11): step 1 farm (note 55, #776), step 2 festival spots
(note 82), step 3 heart events and spouses (note 84, #600), step 4 interior plans
(note 86), step 11 farmhouse and cabin drafts (note 85, build issues next).

- Step 5: Layout page design note. Drafted (note 87), small points decided. Next: file
  the slice 1 and 2 issues.
- Step 6 (owner): Hands-on play of the built areas to check placeholder metrics (paths
  2 wide, doors 1, 60 s on foot and 30 s on the horse to cross).
- Step 7: Build the layout page, before the valley and festival layouts.
- Step 8: Wait for the M4 spike (jam freeing, tablet map memory; may change the
  120 by 120 cap).
- Step 9: Valley maps, area by area (note 71 order), after step 6.
- Step 10: Festival layouts, from step 2.
- Step 12: Mines, after combat leftovers (#598).
- Steps 13 to 16 (M3d): `above` layer and seasonal tilesets, reference images and
  style sheet, licence ADR for generated art, the art swap.
- The other interiors are built (note 86, #853 to #860) from the checked drafts, with the
  shared test `tests/interior-reach.test.ts` and the converter
  `scripts/interiors/tmj-to-map.mjs`. Left: the hall layout (no draft, one player tile at
  each counter), the owner's call on the `AISLE_EXCEPTIONS` lists, game code that reads
  `gate` (friendship doors), spouse route code (note 84), decor zones for renovation
  rooms, the cabin (M4).

## Leftovers and housekeeping

- Slice 1 leftovers are tracked in #522 and #521. Bundles: #181, #201 (note 63).
- Tablet check (#336), notes 45 and 60 open items, barn stall wing, note 54 answer
  sheet.
